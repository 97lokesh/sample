HTTP;
       *HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocols and is used to client server communication.
       *HTTP user sends the request to the server and server sends response to the user.
       *There are several stages of HTTP development and we will focus mainly HTTP1.1 which was created in 1997 and HTTP2 which was created in 2015.


                                        HTTP1.1
*Developed by Timothy Berners-Lee in 1989 as a communication standard for the World Wide Web, HTTP is a top-level application protocol that exchanges information between a client computer and a local or remote web server. 
*In this process, a client sends a text-based request to a server by calling a method like GET or POST. In response, the server sends a resource like an HTML page back to the client.
*It works on the textual format
*There is head of line blocking that blocks all the request behind until it doesn’t get its all resources
*It uses request resources inlining for use getting multiple pages
*It compresses data by itself

                                       HTTP2
*HTTP/2 began as the SPDY protocol, developed primarily at Google with the intention of reducing web page load latency by using techniques such as compression, multiplexing, and prioritization
*This protocol served as a template for HTTP/2 when the Hypertext Transfer Protocol working group httpbis of the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) put the standard together, culminating in the publication of HTTP/2 in May 2015
*It works on the binary protocol
*It allows multiplexing to one TCP connection is required for multiple requests
*It uses push frame by server that collects all multiple pages 
*It uses H PACK for data compression
       

                                              OBJECTS AND ITS INTERNAL REPRESENTATION
*Object are important data types in java script. Object are different than primitive data types (I,e, number,string,Boolean,etc.).

*Primitive data type contain only one value but object data type contain many values in form of key;value pair.

*These keys can be variables or functions are called properties and methods,in the context of object.

*Internally, objects are stored as a collection of key-value pairs, where the keys are the property names and the values can be data or references to functions.

*When you access an object’s property or method, JavaScript searches for the property name in the object’s internal collection of key-value pairs.
